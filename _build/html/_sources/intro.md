# Computer Graphics

This site contains the notes used for the lab sessions for the Computer Graphics module. They are designed for students to work through in the labs with the help of the tutors. The content of each of the labs have been organised such that each one uses to what you have learned from the preceding labs so it is important that you make sure you keep up with these. 

These materials are based upon the excellent OpenGL tutorials <a href="https://learnopengl.com/" target="_blank">learnOpenGL</a> by Joey de Vries and <a href="https://www.opengl-tutorial.org/" target="_blank">open-gl-tutorial</a>.

| Lab | Content |
|:--:|:--|
|  1 | [Introduction to C++](intro-to-cpp-section): Introduction/revision of C++ fundamentals. Variables, arrays, loops and if statements. Functions, classes, methods and header files.  |
|  2 |  [Drawing Basic Shapes in OpenGL](basic-shapes-section): Window creation in OpenGL, Vertex Array Objects (VAO) and Vertex Buffer Objects (VBO), fragment and vertex shaders. |
|  3 | [Textures](textures-section): texture co-ordinates, mipmaps, texture filtering, applying texture maps to polygons. |
|  4 | [Vectors and Matrices](vectors-and-matrices-section): Revision of vectors and matrices. Dot and cross products, matrix multiplication, transpose, the identity matrix and matrix inverse.
|  5 | [Transformations](transformations-section): Translation, scaling and rotation transformations. Applying transformations to polygons. |
|  6 | [3D Worlds](3D-worlds-section): Co-ordinate systems, the view, model and projection matrices. |
|  7 | [Moving the Camera](moving-the-camera-section): using keyboard input, using mouse input, back face culling |
