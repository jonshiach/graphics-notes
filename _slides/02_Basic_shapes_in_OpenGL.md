- [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/){target="_blank"} (Open Graphics Library) is a cross-platform open standard API for rendering 2D and 3D graphics

- Originally developed by Silicon Graphics who released the code to the open standard, since 2006 it has been managed by the [Khronos Group](https://www.khronos.org/){target="_blank"}

- OpenGL serves as an interface between software and hardware

- Used in the creation of computer games, graphical simulations, and CAD systems

- Has been superseded by [Vulkan]("https://www.vulkan.org/"){target="_blank"} which is a low-level API - more efficient but requires memory management and more difficult to get started
